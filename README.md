# MNIST
> The purpose of the project was to create a neural network that could categorize handwritten digits into one of ten classes.

## What is MNIST?
MNIST is a dataset containing 70,000 handwritten digits splited into training data (60,000) and test data(10,000). All images were scaled to 28x28px and are grayscale with intensity in range of 0-255.
